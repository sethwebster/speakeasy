# Speakeasy
I quickly built this app after my pops, battling Parkinson's disease for nearly 20 years, as he lost his ability to make precise movement, and verbally communicate. I wanted to know and understand his needs as I sat bedside, and I built this React app over the course of an evening.

The premise is that a screen is displayed with phrases or letters. The selected letter or phrase change on a timer, and all the person has to do is press the `left mouse button`, or `enter`.

I don't know if this will be of use to others, but it was meaningful for me to share this, in the hopes of something good coming from this difficult time.

**There Are Bugs** but I wasn't going for perfect (just check out the inline styles ðŸ˜€), just useful. If this is of use to you, please send a PR and make it better.
